        <p>
            I'm a PhD student studying Physical Oceanography. I'm interested in the dynamics
            that govern our oceans and their intricate connections with the climate system.
            My current research focuses on the Southern Ocean, a crucial region that plays
            a key role in regulating global climate patterns. I am particularly interested in
            how advanced climate models capture the complex processes in the Southern Ocean,
            and how can we improve our understanding of climate behavior and its implications
            for the future.
